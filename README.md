# Autocomplete (Coding Exercise)
Create a web service that takes a string and then returns a list of words that start with that string. If you are on a Mac you can use /usr/share/dict/words as the source of words. If you are on *nix environment or Windows check Google for where the dict file is stored.

https://phpword.herokuapp.com/ has the hosted code.  Each word can be clicked on to get the definition for that word.
